    <p>The terrific acceleration of the saucer as it left Earth twisted Billy's slumbering body, distorted his face, dislodged him in time, sent him back to the war.</p>

    <p>When he regained consciousness, he wasn't on the flying saucer. He was in a boxcar crossing Germany again.</p>

    <p>Some people were rising from the floor of the car, and others were lying down. Billy planned to lie down, too. It would be lovely to sleep. It was black in the car, and black outside the car, which seemed to be about two miles an hour. The car never seemed to go any faster than that. It was a long time between clicks, between joints in the track. There would be a click, and then a year would go by, and then there would be another click.</p>

    <p>The train often stopped to let really important trains bawl and hurtle by. Another thing it did was stop on sidings near prisons, leaving a few cars there. It was creeping across all of Germany, growing shorter all the time</p>

    <p>And Billy let himself down oh so gradually now, hanging onto the diagonal cross- brace in the comer in order to make himself seem nearly weightless to those he was joining on the floor. He knew it was important that he made himself nearly ghostlike when lying down. He had forgotten why, but a reminder soon came.</p>

    <p>'Pilgrim,' said a person he was about to nestle with, 'is that you?'</p>

  <p>Billy didn't say anything, but nestled very politely, closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>'God damn it' said the person. 'That is you, isn't it?' He sat up and explored Billy rudely with his hands. 'It's you, all right. Get the hell out of here.' Now Billy sat up, too-wretched, close to tears. 'Get out of here! I want to sleep!' 'Shut up,' said somebody else.</p>

  <p>'I'll shut up when Pilgrim gets away from here.'</p>
